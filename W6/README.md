# Building Generative AI Applications

**Objective**: The student is able to build generative AI applications, to provide value to the business. This goes beyond copy-pasting into commonly available tools like Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, etc. Rather, they are able to:

1. **Evaluate**: the needs of the business, and the data available to them, and the constraints they are working with.
2. **Customize**: apply application-specific logic to target pain points and opportunities in the business.
3. **Automate**: automate this process on much more data, with better quality, and at a lower cost.
4. **Integrate**: into an existing system workflows, seamlessly without breaking them (e.g., a CRM system, a marketing automation platform, etc.)
5. **Scale**: on much more data (e.g., from few to millions of documents) within constraints: quality, time, and cost.
6. **Maintainable**: not a one-off solution that will break next month when circumstances change.
