    "    \"Chapter 1: Solar Energy Initiatives\\n\"\n",
    "    \"The solar energy program aims to install 50 gigawatts of photovoltaic capacity by 2030. \"\n",
    "    \"Key initiatives include rooftop solar subsidies for residential properties, large-scale solar farms in desert regions, \"\n",
    "    \"and integration with smart grid technologies. The program includes tax incentives for commercial installations and \"\n",
    "    \"streamlined permitting processes for solar projects exceeding 1 megawatt capacity.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 2: Wind Energy Development\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Wind energy targets include 30 gigawatts of onshore and offshore wind capacity. Priority regions have been identified \"\n",
    "    \"based on wind speed data collected over the past five years. Offshore wind farms will be developed in three phases, \"\n",
    "    \"with the first phase expected to generate 5 gigawatts by 2026. Onshore projects will focus on rural areas with minimal \"\n",
    "    \"environmental impact, requiring environmental impact assessments before approval.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 3: Hydroelectric Power Expansion\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Existing hydroelectric facilities will be upgraded to increase efficiency by 15%. New small-scale hydroelectric projects \"\n",
    "    \"will be developed in mountainous regions, with a target of 10 gigawatts additional capacity. These projects must comply \"\n",
    "    \"with strict environmental regulations to protect aquatic ecosystems and fish migration patterns.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 4: Geothermal Energy Exploration\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Geothermal energy represents an underutilized resource with significant potential. The policy allocates $2 billion for \"\n",
    "    \"geothermal exploration and development over the next six years. Initial focus areas include regions with known geothermal \"\n",
    "    \"activity, where drilling operations will assess resource viability. Successful projects will receive government funding \"\n",
    "    \"covering up to 40% of development costs.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 5: Grid Modernization and Storage\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Modernizing the electrical grid is essential for integrating renewable sources. The policy mandates smart grid upgrades \"\n",
    "    \"in all major metropolitan areas by 2028. Battery storage systems will be deployed at renewable energy sites to address \"\n",
    "    \"intermittency issues. The target is 20 gigawatt-hours of storage capacity, utilizing both lithium-ion and emerging \"\n",
    "    \"technologies like flow batteries and compressed air energy storage.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 6: Economic Incentives and Funding\\n\"\n",
    "    \"The government will provide $50 billion in funding through various mechanisms: direct grants, low-interest loans, tax credits, \"\n",
    "    \"and public-private partnerships. Small businesses and residential customers can access rebates covering 30% of installation \"\n",
    "    \"costs. Large-scale projects may qualify for accelerated depreciation schedules and reduced corporate tax rates.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 7: Workforce Development\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Training programs will be established to develop a skilled workforce for the renewable energy sector. Technical colleges \"\n",
    "    \"will receive funding to expand renewable energy curricula. Apprenticeship programs will connect 10,000 workers with \"\n",
    "    \"renewable energy companies over the next five years. Certification programs will be standardized across all regions.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 8: Environmental Impact and Regulations\\n\"\n",
    "    \"All renewable energy projects must undergo comprehensive environmental impact assessments. Projects affecting protected \"\n",
    "    \"wildlife habitats require additional mitigation measures. The policy establishes a carbon offset program where renewable \"\n",
    "    \"energy generation can be traded. Strict monitoring and reporting requirements ensure compliance with environmental standards.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 9: International Cooperation\\n\"\n",
    "    \"The framework includes provisions for international partnerships and technology transfer. Bilateral agreements with leading \"\n",
    "    \"renewable energy nations will facilitate knowledge sharing and joint research initiatives. The country will participate in \"\n",
    "    \"global climate initiatives and contribute to international renewable energy standards development.\\n\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Chapter 10: Implementation Timeline and Milestones\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Phase 1 (2024-2026): Foundation and pilot projects. Establish regulatory framework, begin large-scale solar installations, \"\n",
    "    \"initiate wind farm development, and launch workforce training programs.\\n\"\n",
    "    \"Phase 2 (2027-2028): Scaling operations. Complete 60% of solar targets, operationalize first offshore wind farms, \"\n",

    "### LLM Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known to have problems on certain tasks, and these challenges still persist when using LLMs as evaluators. For example:\n",
    "- LLMs can struggle with numerical problems (like counting characters in a word)\n",
    "- They may not accurately evaluate tasks that require precise measurements\n",
    "- They can be biased based on their training data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are solutions available in some cases, such as connecting tools to handle problems unsuitable to a language model, but it's important that you understand possible limitations and include human evaluators to calibrate your evaluation system and determine a baseline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One reason that LLM evaluators work well is that all of the information they need is available in the input context, so the model only needs to attend to that information to produce the result. When customizing evaluation prompts, or building your own systems, keep this in mind and ensure that you are not relying on \"internal knowledge\" from the model, or behavior that might be better provided from a tool."
